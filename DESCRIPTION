Description: qMAP detects differentially fragmented parental RNAs under specific conditions. qMAP tool, which consists of two computational strategies (i.e., Model 1 and Model 2) and is based on the sequencing reads mapped to parental RNAs. 
	Additionally, a qMAP_mh module is developed, which identifies specific sncRNA species contributing to differential fragmentation by applying Mantel-Haenszel test to sequencing read distributions along parental RNAs across different conditions.
